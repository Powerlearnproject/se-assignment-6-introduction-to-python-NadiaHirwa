 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Answers:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key features that make Python popular among developers:

Key Features of Python Programming

https://d8it4huxumps7.cloudfront.net/uploads/images/650880087c0f5_features_of_python_01.jpg

Here are a few features of Python that make it a popular programming language in today's time. 

1. Portable Language:
It is a cross-platform language. It can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. For example, you can run the Python code for Windows in Linux or macOS, too.
2. Standard Library:
It offers various modules like operators, mathematical functions, libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow, etc., and packages paving the way for the developers to save time to avoid re-writing the codes from scratch. To provide more functionality and packages, they also provide Python Package Index.
3. High-Level Language:
It is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Unlike machine language like C, C++, It is a human-readable language. In other words, even a layman can understand the programs.

4. Easy to learn and use:
It is easy to understand and easy to code, and anyone can learn Python within a few days. For example, a simple Python program to add two numbers is as follows:
a = 8
b = 9
print(a+b)
We have completed this program within three lines. Whereas in Java, C++ and C, it takes more lines. That is why Python is known as an easy and precise language.
5. Dynamic Language:
Declaring the type of a variable is not needed. For example, let us declare an integer number 7 for a variable a. Rather than declare it as:
int a = 7 ( this is necessary for statically-typed language like C)
We declare it as
a = 7
But, the programmers have to be careful regarding runtime errors.
6. Extensible Language:
Code can be used to compile in C or C++ language so that it can be utilized for our Python code. This is achieved because it converts the program to byte code.

7. Interpreted Language:
Line-by-line execution of source code, converted into byte code; thus, compiling the code is not necessary, making it easy to debug if required.
8. Object-Oriented Programming Language:
It supports procedural, functional, structural, and also object-oriented language such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism which is considered important by the Python coder.
9. Free and Open-source libraries:
It is a free open-source platform that can be downloaded easily from their Official Website.
10. Support is provided for Graphical User Interface:
Lots of Graphical User Interface frameworks are available in Python, thus helping the software user, and it sticks to platform-specific technologies. It can be used in software development, web development, etc

Use Cases Where Python is Particularly Effective

1. Web Development: Python frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build robust web applications.

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are widely used for data manipulation and visualization.

import pandas as pd
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter'], 'Age': [28, 24, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

3. Machine Learning: Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn make Python a go-to language for machine learning projects.

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

iris = load_iris()
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)

4. Automation and Scripting: Python is often used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

import os
for filename in os.listdir('.'):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'):
        print(filename)

5. Game Development: Libraries like Pygame enable developers to create simple games.

import pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))
running = True

while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
pygame.quit()


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   Answers:
   
   Python Installation on Windows

The installation requires downloading the official Python .exe installer and running it on your system. The sections below will explain several options and details during the installation process.

>Step 1: Select Python Version

   Deciding on a version depends on what you want to do in Python. The two major versions are Python2 and Python3. Choosing one over the other might be better depending on your project details. If there are no constraints, choose whichever one you prefer.
   .We recommend Python 3, as Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Download Python 2 only if you work with legacy scripts and older projects. Also, choose a stable release over the newest since the newest release may have bugs and issues.

>Step 2: Download Python Executable Installer

   Start by downloading the Python executable installer for Windows:
   1. Open a web browser and navigate to the Downloads for Windows section of the official Python website.
   2. Locate the desired Python version.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-executable-download-page-64-and-32-bit.png
   3. Click the link to download the file. Choose either the Windows 32-bit or 64-bit installer.
   The download is approximately 25MB.

>Step 3: Run Executable Installer

   The steps below guide you through the installation process:
   1. Run the downloaded Python Installer.
   2. The installation window shows two checkboxes:
      Admin privileges. The parameter controls whether to install Python for the current or all system users. This option allows you to change the installation folder for Python.
      Add Python to PATH. The second option places the executable in the PATH variable after installation. You can also add Python to the PATH environment variable manually later.
         https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-installer-admin-privileges-and-path.png
      For the most straightforward installation, we recommend ticking both checkboxes.
   3. Select the Install Now option for the recommended installation (in that case, skip the next two steps).
      To adjust the default installation options, choose Customize installation instead and proceed to the following step.
         https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-installer-install-now-or-customize.png
      The default installation installs Python to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version] for the current user. It includes IDLE (the default Python editor), the PIP package manager, and additional documentation. The installer also creates necessary shortcuts and file associations.
      Customizing the installation allows changing these installation options and parameters.
   4. Choose the optional installation features. Python works without these features, but adding them improves   the program's usability.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-installer-optional-features.png
      Click Next to proceed to the Advanced Options screen.
   5. The second part of customizing the installation includes advanced options.
      Choose whether to install Python for all users. The option changes the install location to C:\Program Files\Python[version]. If selecting the location manually, a common choice is C:\Python[version] because it avoids spaces in the path, and all users can access it. Due to administrative rights, both paths may cause issues during package installation.
      Other advanced options include creating shortcuts, file associations, and adding Python to PATH.
         https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-installer-advanced-options.png
      After picking the appropriate options, click Install to start the installation.
   6. Select whether to disable the path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-installer-setup-successful.png
      The option will not affect any other system settings, and disabling it resolves potential name-length issues. We recommend selecting the option and closing the setup.
   
>Step 4: Add Python to Path (Optional)

If the Python installer does not include the Add Python to PATH checkbox or you have not selected that option, continue in this step. Otherwise, skip to the next step.
Adding the Python path to the PATH variable alleviates the need to use the full path to access the Python program in the command line. It instructs Windows to review all the folders added to the PATH environment variable and to look for the python.exe program in those folders.
   To add Python to PATH, do the following:
   1. In the Start menu, search for Environment Variables and press Enter.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/start-environment-variables.png
   2. Click Environment Variables to open the overview screen.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/system-properties-environment-variables.png
   3. Double-click Path on the list to edit it.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/environment-variables-list-path.png
      Alternatively, select the variable and click the Edit button.
   4. Double-click the first empty field and paste the Python installation folder path.
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/path-python-pip-new-entry.png
   Alternatively, click the New button instead and paste the path.
   5. Click OK to save the changes. If the command prompt is open, restart it for the following step.

>Step 5: Verify Python Was Installed on Windows

   The first way to verify that Python was installed successfully is through the command line. Open the command prompt and run the following command:
      "python --version"
   The output shows the installed Python version.
   The second way is to use the GUI to verify the Python installation. Follow the steps below to run the Python interpreter or IDLE:
   1. Navigate to the directory where Python was installed on the system.
   2. Double-click python.exe (the Python interpreter) or IDLE.
   3. The interpreter opens the command prompt and shows the following window:
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-3.12.0-interpreter-window.png
   Running IDLE opens Python's built-in IDE
      https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/python-3.12.0-idle-shell.png
   In both cases, the installed Python version shows on the screen, and the editor is ready for use.

>Step 6: Verify PIP Was Installed

   To verify whether PIP was installed, enter the following command in the command prompt:
      "pip --version"
   PIP has not been installed yet if you get the following output:
      "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, Operable program or batch file."

>Step 7: Install virtualenv (Optional)

   Python software packages install system-wide by default. Consequently, whenever a single project-specific package is changed, it changes for all your Python projects.
   The virtualenv package enables making isolated local virtual environments for Python projects. Virtual environments help avoid package conflicts and enable choosing specific package versions per project.
   To install virtualenv, run the following command in the command prompt:
      "pip install virtualenv"
         https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pip-install-virtualenv-cmd-output.png


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
Answers:

Simple Python Program: "Hello, World!"
code:
   print("Hello, World!")

Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements

1. Function Call:
   ."print" is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.
   .Functions in Python are called by their name followed by parentheses "()".

2. String:
   ."Hello, World!" is a string literal in Python.
   .Strings in Python can be enclosed in single quotes ' or double quotes ". Here, double quotes are used.

3. Parentheses:
   .The parentheses () are used to pass arguments to functions.
   .In this case, the string "Hello, World!" is the argument passed to the print function.

4. Newline Character:
   .After the function call, the newline character \n is implicitly added at the end of the printed string, moving the cursor to the next line in the console.

Basic Syntax Elements

>Comments:
Comments in Python start with the # symbol and are not executed by the interpreter.
Example: # This is a comment

>Variables:
Variables are used to store data values.
Example: message = "Hello, World!"

>Indentation:
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.
Example:
if True:
    print("This is indented")

Putting It All Together
Here’s a slightly more complex example that includes comments, variables, and indentation:
   # Define a variable
   message = "Hello, World!"
   # Print the message
   print(message)

In this example:
   .A variable named message is defined and assigned the string "Hello, World!".
   .The print function is then used to print the value of the message variable to the console.
These basic syntax elements form the foundation of Python programming.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Answers:

   Basic Data Types in Python
Python supports several built-in data types, which can be categorized into the following main categories:

1. Numeric Types:
int: Integer numbers, e.g., 5, -10, 1000.
float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 1.0.

2. Sequence Types:
str: String, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, e.g., "Hello", 'Python'.
list: List, an ordered collection of items, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].
tuple: Tuple, an ordered collection of items (immutable), e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').

3. Boolean Type:
bool: Boolean, represents True or False.

4. Set Types:
set: Set, an unordered collection of unique items, e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}.
frozenset: Frozen set, an immutable set, e.g., frozenset({1, 2, 3}).

5. Mapping Type:
dict: Dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}.

Short Script Demonstrating Data Types and Variables

Here’s a Python script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:
   # Integer variable
   age = 25
   # Float variable
   height = 1.75
   # String variable
   name = "John Doe"
   # List variable
   fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   # Tuple variable
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   # Boolean variable
   is_student = True
   # Dictionary variable
   person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
   # Print variables and their types
   print(f"Name: {name}, Type: {type(name)}")
   print(f"Age: {age}, Type: {type(age)}")
   print(f"Height: {height}, Type: {type(height)}")
   print(f"Fruits: {fruits}, Type: {type(fruits)}")
   print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}, Type: {type(coordinates)}")
   print(f"Is student: {is_student}, Type: {type(is_student)}")
   print(f"Person: {person}, Type: {type(person)}")
Explanation:
   .Variables: Each variable (age, height, name, fruits, coordinates, is_student, person) is assigned a value of a specific data type.
   .Data Types: The type() function is used to print the type of each variable.
   .Output: The print() function displays the value and type of each variable to the console.
This script demonstrates the versatility of Python's data types and how variables can store different kinds of information, from simple numbers and strings to complex structures like lists and dictionaries.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Answers:

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

Syntax:
   if condition:
       # code to execute if condition is True
   else:
       # code to execute if condition is False
Example:
   # Example of an if-else statement
   age = 18
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are an adult.")
   else:
       print("You are a minor.")

Explanation:
   .In this example, the age variable is set to 18.
   .The if statement checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
   .If the condition (age >= 18) evaluates to True, it prints "You are an adult.".
   .Otherwise, if the condition is False, it prints "You are a minor.".

Loops ("for" Loop)
Loops in Python allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code multiple times or iterate over a sequence of items.

Syntax:
   for item in sequence:
       # code to execute for each item

Example:
   # Example of a for loop
   fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)

Explanation:
   In this example, fruits is a list containing three strings ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry').
   The for loop iterates over each item (fruit) in the fruits list.
   During each iteration, it prints the value of fruit.
Output:
   apple
   banana
   cherry

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Answers:

   What are Python Functions?

A collection of related assertions that carry out a mathematical, analytical, or evaluative operation is known as a function. An assortment of proclamations called Python Capabilities returns the specific errand. Python functions are necessary for intermediate-level programming and are easy to define. Function names meet the same standards as variable names do. The objective is to define a function and group-specific frequently performed actions. Instead of repeatedly creating the same code block for various input variables, we can call the function and reuse the code it contains with different variables.
Client-characterized and worked-in capabilities are the two primary classes of capabilities in Python. It aids in maintaining the program's uniqueness, conciseness, and structure.

Why are Functions Useful?
   >Modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to maintain and debug.
   >Code Reusability: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times from different parts of the program without rewriting the code.
   >Abstraction: Functions hide the details of implementation, allowing you to focus on the higher-level logic of your program

   Example: Python Function to Calculate Sum
Here's a Python function that takes two arguments (a and b) and returns their sum:
 def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """Function to calculate the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b
Explanation:

calculate_sum is the function name.
a and b are parameters (input values) passed to the function.
The return statement specifies the value that the function should return when called with specific arguments.
Calling the Function
After defining the function, you can call it from anywhere in your code:
   # Call the calculate_sum function
   result = calculate_sum(5, 3)  
   # Print the result
   print("The sum is:", result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Answers:

   Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries
Lists:
   .Definition: Lists are ordered collections of items that are indexed by integers. They can contain elements of different data types.
   .Access: Elements in a list are accessed by their index, starting from 0.
   .Mutability: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, and remove elements after defining the list.
   .Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Dictionaries:
   .Definition: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique within the dictionary, and keys can be of immutable types (strings, numbers, tuples).
   .Access: Elements in a dictionary are accessed by their keys, rather than by index.
   .Mutability: Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to modify, add, or delete key-value pairs.
   .Example: person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

   Script Demonstrating Lists and Dictionaries
Here's a Python script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, and demonstrates basic operations on both:
   # Create a list of numbers
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   # Create a dictionary of person's details
   person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
   # Print the list and dictionary
   print("List of numbers:", numbers)
   print("Dictionary of person's details:", person)
   # Accessing elements
   print("\nAccessing elements:")
   print("First number in the list:", numbers[0])
   print("Age of the person:", person['age'])
   # Modifying elements
   print("\nModifying elements:")
   numbers[0] = 10
   person['city'] = 'San Francisco'
   print("Updated list of numbers:", numbers)
   print("Updated dictionary of person's details:", person)
   # Adding elements
   print("\nAdding elements:")
   numbers.append(6)
   person['gender'] = 'Female'
   print("List after adding an element:", numbers)
   print("Dictionary after adding a new key-value pair:", person)
   # Removing elements
   print("\nRemoving elements:")
   removed_number = numbers.pop(2)
   removed_city = person.pop('city')
   print("List after removing an element:", numbers)
   print("Removed city from the dictionary:", removed_city)
   print("Dictionary after removing a key-value pair:", person)

   Output:
   List of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      Dictionary of person's details: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
      Accessing elements:
      First number in the list: 1
      Age of the person: 30
      Modifying elements:
      Updated list of numbers: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      Updated dictionary of person's details: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'San Francisco'}
      Adding elements:
      List after adding an element: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      Dictionary after adding a new key-value pair: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'San Francisco', 'gender': 'Female'}
      Removing elements:
      List after removing an element: [10, 2, 4, 5, 6]
      Removed city from the dictionary: San Francisco
      Dictionary after removing a key-value pair: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'gender': 'Female'}

Explanation:
   Lists: Operations include accessing elements by index (numbers[0]), modifying elements (numbers[0] = 10, numbers.append(6)), and removing elements (numbers.pop(2)).
   Dictionaries: Operations include accessing elements by key (person['age']), modifying elements (person['city'] = 'San Francisco', person['gender'] = 'Female'), and removing elements (person.pop('city')).

This script demonstrates the fundamental differences between lists and dictionaries in Python and illustrates basic operations you can perform on each data structure. Lists are useful for ordered collections, while dictionaries are handy for storing key-value pairs where keys provide a unique identifier for each value.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Answers:

Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. It allows you to gracefully manage unexpected situations without the program crashing.

Components of Exception Handling
   .try: This block contains the code that might raise an exception. It's the block where you want to monitor for exceptions.
   .except: If an exception occurs in the try block, Python jumps to the except block to handle the exception. You can specify which type of exception to catch (e.g., ZeroDivisionError, TypeError) or use a generic Exception to catch all types of exceptions.
   .finally: This block is optional. It is always executed whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources.

Example of Using try, except, and finally

Here's an example Python script demonstrating exception handling:
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero!")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"Result of division: {result}")
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")

# Example usage
divide_numbers(10, 2)   # Normal case
print("---")
divide_numbers(10, 0)   # Division by zero
print("---")
divide_numbers(10, '2') # Type error

Output:
Result of division: 5.0
Execution completed.
---
Error: Division by zero!
Execution completed.
---
Error: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
Execution completed.

Explanation:
try block: Contains the code that might raise an exception. In this example, result = a / b might raise exceptions like ZeroDivisionError or TypeError.

except blocks: Each except block handles specific types of exceptions. If a matching exception occurs, the corresponding block is executed. If no exception occurs, the else block is executed.

else block: Executes if no exceptions are raised in the try block. In this example, it prints the result of division.

finally block: Always executes after the try and except blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is used for cleanup actions.

In this script:

divide_numbers(10, 2) executes normally, printing the result of division (5.0).
divide_numbers(10, 0) raises a ZeroDivisionError, caught in the corresponding except block.
divide_numbers(10, '2') raises a TypeError, caught in its respective except block.
Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully, ensuring your program can recover from unexpected situations and continue execution without crashing.


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   Answers:

   Modules
In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions. It serves as a way to organize Python code into reusable units. You can import modules in other Python scripts to use their functionality.
   .Creating a Module: Any Python file can be a module. You can create your own modules by saving Python code in a .py file.

Packages
A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that contains multiple modules and subpackages. It allows you to organize and distribute Python modules and provides a way to manage namespaces in Python.
   .Creating a Package: Packages are directories that include a special file called __init__.py. This file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
Importing and Using Modules

To import a module in Python, you use the import statement. There are different ways to import modules:
   .Importing the Entire Module: import module_name
   .Importing Specific Functions/Classes: from module_name import function_name, class_name
   .Importing with Alias: import module_name as alias

Example Using the math Module
The math module provides mathematical functions and constants. Here's how you can import and use the math module in a Python script:

# Importing the entire math module
import math

# Using functions from the math module
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)              # Output: 3.141592653589793

# Importing specific functions or constants from the math module
from math import factorial, e

# Using imported functions or constants
print("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5))      # Output: 120
print("Value of Euler's number (e):", e)    # Output: 2.718281828459045

# Importing with alias
import math as m

# Using the alias to access module functions
print("Cosine of 0 radians:", m.cos(0))     # Output: 1.0

Explanation:

1. import math: Imports the entire math module. Functions and constants from math are accessed using dot notation (math.sqrt, math.pi).
2. from math import factorial, e: Imports specific functions (factorial) and constants (e) from the math module directly into the script's namespace. They can be used without the math. prefix.
3. import math as m: Imports the math module with an alias m. Functions and constants can be accessed using m. instead of math..

Modules and packages are fundamental to organizing and reusing Python code effectively. They help in managing code complexity, promoting code reuse, and enhancing maintainability across projects.


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Answers:

File I/O (Input/Output) operations in Python allow you to read data from files and write data to files. Python provides built-in functions and methods for handling files efficiently.

Reading from a File

To read from a file in Python:
   >Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
   >Read the Content: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the content of the file.
   >Close the File: Always close the file using the close() method.

# Example: Reading from a file
file_path = 'sample.txt'

try:
    # Open file in read mode
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read and print the content
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: Unable to read the file '{file_path}'.")

To write to a file in Python:
   >Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('w' for writing).
   >Write Data: Use methods like write() to write data to the file.
   >Close the File: Always close the file using the close() method or use the with statement for automatic closing.

# Example: Writing to a file
output_file = 'output.txt'
data = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]

try:
    # Open file in write mode
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        # Write data to the file
        file.writelines(data)
    print(f"Data has been written to '{output_file}' successfully.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: Unable to write to the file '{output_file}'.")
